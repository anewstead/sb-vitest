## Atomic Design

Component library follows Atomic Design Pattern principles.

Each level leading up to pages is stateless and non-specific to content and functionality.  
Components expect any specific information to be passed into them.  
Its all about making things highly reusable.

### Atoms

Most basic cannot be subdivided

### Molecules

Composes only atoms

### Organisms

Composes molecules and atoms

### Templates

Layouts, typically of pages, composes organisms, molecules and (rarely) atoms

### Pages

Pages are STATEFUL, here meaning they have specific content.  
However content, functionality, services and state should all be mocked inside storybook.  
It is possible to show the actual page with all the above mocked, though may not want to if very complex,  
but as such any pages inside the component library should only really be to illustrate a visual of a template.  
That is, they are still essentially flat and should not connect to full interactivity and real world content or business logic.
