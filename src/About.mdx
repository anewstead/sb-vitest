## Atomic Design

Component library follows Atomic Design Pattern principles.

Each level leading up to pages is stateless and non-specific to content and functionality.  
Components expect any specific information to be passed into them.  
Its all about making things highly reusable.

### Atoms

Most basic cannot be subdivided

### Molecules

Composes only atoms

### Organisms

Composes molecules and atoms

### Templates

Layouts, typically of pages, composes organisms, molecules and (rarely) atoms

### Pages

Pages are STATEFUL, and are the actual production page, meaning they are specific.  
Importantly however all content, functionality, services and state should all be mocked inside storybook.  
It is possible to show the actual page but you shouldn't!  
You want a clear indication of mocked content e.g. Lorem ipsum,  
and you do not want for example a navigation item to click to another page,  
As such pages as seen inside the component library should be quite flat and only really illustrative.  
That is, should intercept/ not connect to full interactivity and real world content or business logic.
