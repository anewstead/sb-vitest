## Atomic Design

Component library follows Atomic Design Pattern principles.

Each level leading up to pages is stateless and non-specific to content and functionality.  
Components expect any specific information to be passed into them.  
Its all about making things highly reusable.

### Atoms

Most basic cannot be subdivided

### Molecules

Composes only atoms

### Organisms

Composes molecules and atoms

### Templates

Layouts, typically of pages, composes organisms, molecules and (rarely) atoms

### Pages

Pages are STATEFUL, meaning here they have specific content.  
Note: If creating pages inside the component library they should only be to illustrate specific visual of a template.  
That is, they are still essentially flat and should not include real world business logic.  
Actual production pages with real world logic should be created outside of the component library.  
Depending on your use case, you might use/extend from a page component, if it is ultimately still flat.  
Although in complex applications its more likely you will recreate from Atom/Molecule/Organism/Template.
